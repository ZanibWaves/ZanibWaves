- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZanibWaves
- 👀 I’m interested in new world building centering equity, inclusion and equal opportunity to communities around the world. I am intersted in impacting positive change through art and music activism, artivism. My passion lies in achieving freedom through healing, creative expression and global problem solving. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the web3 ecosystem and learning how to build and evolve spaces for communities that are often marginalized from opportunities that can create levels of freedom.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on music, defi, crypto techonology and NFTs to bring back to our communities to make real life change to give our communities the things they are lacking
